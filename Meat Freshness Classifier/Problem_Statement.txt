Problem Statement: 
  The objective is to develop a robust model capable of categorizing meat freshness into three distinct levels: fresh, partially fresh, and rotten. 
  This endeavor seeks to address the critical need within the industry for precise and timely assessment of meat quality, mitigating potential health risks associated with consuming 
  spoiled products. 
  Through advanced machine learning techniques, the model aims to discern subtle indicators of degradation and spoilage, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding meat 
  consumption and distribution. 
  This initiative aligns with broader efforts to enhance food safety standards and ensure consumer confidence in the freshness and integrity of meat products.
